# Low-level design (LLD)

This document maps runtime behavior to source modules. Tests beside a module exercise its pure/security-sensitive behavior.

## Backend composition

`server.ts` loads environment first, configures Helmet/CORS/body/rate limits, mounts routes, maintains a cached 30-second Firestore/RTDB health probe, starts the HTTP listener and worker coordinator, and drains HTTP/worker/Firebase resources on SIGTERM/SIGINT. Telemetry bypasses the broad global limit but has its own IP and device limits. Body parsing is 512 bytes on telemetry and 16 KiB elsewhere.

## Telemetry service detail

Credential cache entries hold `{assignment, secretDigest, expiresAt}`; positive TTL is 60 seconds, negative TTL 5 seconds, and capacity 1,000. A SHA-256 digest makes cached comparisons constant-size; the durable store remains scrypt. Rate buckets are per device and one minute with a default budget of 90. Distributed mode reserves five tokens per shared transaction by default and bounds local leases to 1,000 devices. Local mode also tracks at most 1,000 devices and fails closed when that table is full.

The RTDB transaction compares `sample.timestamp` plus sequence to existing telemetry. Older/equal samples abort and return duplicate success. New data merges the accepted sample without overwriting an existing active lifecycle, preserves the authenticated fix in `rawLocation`, adds server timing, and derives `deviceState`/`signalState`. A missing active session schedules one coalesced Firestore recovery read per node with a 30-second negative cache.

Accepted fixes schedule (but never await) per-node route processing. Stored forward and reverse polylines are independently computed; legacy documents are repaired and cached. Projection scores distance, heading, backwards progress and segment jumps. Each completed pass stamps its sample identity. Confident current-sample matches populate `matchedLocation`; while an on-route sample is still pending, clients retain the previous confident match for at most two seconds before showing the accepted raw coordinate. Low-confidence, off-route, route-context-change and reconnect states use raw GNSS immediately and are marked uncertain. Three reliable moving deviations transition `ON_ROUTE → POSSIBLE_OFF_ROUTE → OFF_ROUTE → REROUTING`. The Routes request includes the next required stops, and activation requires the same request ID, route version, direction and session before incrementing the version and publishing `ON_NEW_ROUTE`.

Metrics retain only the latest 512 in-memory samples. Restart resets counters; metrics are diagnostic rather than billing/history.

## Trip-state detail

Normalized live data is processed serially per RTDB child. Routes are cached from a Firestore snapshot listener; missing IDs have a 60-second negative cache and listener reconnect uses 1–30 second backoff. `processedTelemetry` accepts only increasing timestamps.

The reducer receives current/previous points, next stop, motion state and existing lifecycle. It can advance one expected stop per fix and never skips ahead. Lifecycle writes are fingerprinted and serialized per bus/ride. Completion uses a Firestore transaction to write history and delete only recovery/lock documents matching the completing session; RTDB writes also compare session ID. Terminal live nodes remain briefly for UI observation and then become offline.

The coordinator stores `_worker_leases/trip-state` with owner and expiry. Only the lease holder runs the engine, abandoned reconciliation, privacy worker and retention. Shutdown stops intake, drains dynamic queues, forces pending completion cleanup, releases the lease conditionally, and then closes Firebase.

## Frontend composition

The Next.js App Router produces a static export. `layout.tsx` installs global metadata, service-worker registration and `Providers`; protected layouts wrap client `RoleGuard` and map context. The landing route is public; passenger, admin and feedback routes are authenticated/no-index.

Tests beside pure frontend libraries exercise freshness, RTDB sharing, route distance/snapping, resume state, history and feedback eligibility.

## Firmware detail

`hardware/src/main.cpp` is a single deterministic loop because it has one UART and one network output. It drains UART on every pass, feeds the watchdog, reconnects Wi-Fi, synchronizes NTP, drops nearly stale buffered fixes, retries the latest buffered fix, evaluates GNSS each second, and warns if no NMEA arrives. `hardware/include/telemetry_policy.h` contains the shared, host-testable distance, heading, motion-hysteresis, retry and publish decisions; the native Unity suite executes those exact production helpers.

`TelemetryFix` is the only queued object; replacement intentionally keeps latest data rather than building an unbounded history. HTTPS 200/202 updates comparison state. Transport errors, 408/425/429 and 5xx retain the latest sample only while it can remain inside the 55-second freshness margin; stale samples are dropped, and bounded `Retry-After` is honored. Permanent HTTP rejection drops that sample and delays the next fresh attempt. GNSS loss sends one `uncertain` sample at the last verified point; it never invents movement. Invalid compile-time configuration halts before networking, and a 401/403 disables the station radio until the applicable configuration or backend registry repair is followed by a restart.

`platformio.ini` pins Espressif32 7.0.1, TinyGPSPlus 1.1.0 and ArduinoJson 7.4.3 and defines native, development, and signed fleet environments. `firmware_config.h` validates the ignored compile-time `secrets.h` contract. `sdkconfig.defaults` enables Secure Boot V2, release-mode flash encryption, ROM-download lockdown, and RAM-only Wi-Fi state for the hybrid Arduino/ESP-IDF fleet build. The ignored RSA-3072 signing key is mandatory for signed fleet artifacts; native tests and regular `esp32dev` builds do not use it. Fleet runtime halts unless both hardware protections are active and the backend origin is HTTPS.

## Configuration/build files

- Root `package.json` is the npm workspace orchestrator. `package-lock.json` is the reproducible dependency graph.
- `scripts/build-production.mjs` enables strict public-variable validation. `generate-sw.mjs` injects the Workbox manifest. `update-csp.mjs` hashes emitted inline scripts into `firebase.json`.
- `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`, rules and indexes define Hosting/Firebase deployment. Generated CSP changes after builds are intentional and must be committed with the output-producing code.
- GitHub workflows install, test/build, run emulators where configured, and scan dependencies/code. Dependabot owns scheduled update proposals.

## Consistency model

RTDB is the immediate latest-value projection; Firestore is durable truth for configuration and recovery/history. A small window can exist between RTDB claim and Firestore active projection. Session IDs and conditional transactions make retries/reconciliation idempotent. Clients must display interruption/staleness rather than infer lifecycle from coordinates alone.

The fleet authorization safety sweep reads the RTDB assignment mirror once and coalesces Firestore bus-route lookups by bus ID while retaining per-driver Auth checks. If the bulk mirror read fails, it falls back to the original per-driver lookup path so an optimization outage cannot disable repair.
