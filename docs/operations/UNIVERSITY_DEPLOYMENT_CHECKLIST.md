# University handover checklist

This document separates university-owned production work from the student's
local professor demonstration.

## Infrastructure and ownership

- [ ] Name owners for Firebase/GCP billing, backend runtime, DNS/TLS, maps
  quotas, incident response, privacy, hardware, and driver onboarding.
- [ ] Provide production Firebase projects, approved regions, budgets, quota
  alerts, backup/export schedules, and separate staging/production data.
- [ ] Run at least two backend replicas behind university-managed HTTPS, a
  load balancer/WAF, edge rate limits, health checks, and restricted
  administration. Set `RATE_LIMIT_SHARD_FACTOR` on every instance to the
  deployed replica count so the in-memory rate limiters enforce the same
  aggregate budget as one instance. The count must not exceed the smallest
  in-process budget (currently 10/minute); use a shared distributed limiter
  beyond that scale. The WAF provides the authoritative global cap (issue #28).
  Configure the load balancer to fail over on non-200
  `/health` (`/health` returns 200 only while both Firestore and RTDB probes
  pass); the Firestore worker lease keeps lifecycle work single-leader across
  replicas, so failover must not duplicate lifecycle transitions.
- [ ] Use Workload Identity or Secret Manager for server credentials; never
  store service-account JSON or secrets in the repository or firmware build
  logs.
- [ ] Set exact `CORS_ORIGIN`, `FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`,
  `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `AUTH_REVOCATION_CACHE_MS`, retention values, and
  worker settings.
- [ ] For an RTDB migration, set both backend/frontend database URL variables
  in the controlled shell, set `RTDB_EXPECTED_REGION`, and run
  `npm run verify:rtdb-instance` before either deployment. Follow the
  [RTDB region decision and rollback plan](../design/RTDB_REGION_LATENCY_DECISION.md).
- [ ] Enforce App Check (console toggle) on Firestore and Realtime Database in
  both projects. Security Rules authorize Firebase Authentication identities
  and roles; App Check is enforced by Firebase, not a `request.app` rule
  predicate. The Admin SDK backend is unaffected. Emulator tests use isolated
  temporary copies via `scripts/rules-for-emulator.mjs`.

## Staging and deployment pipeline

- [ ] Confirm the approved staging Firebase project configured in `.firebaserc`
  and the deploy workflow, and configure it with App Check (ReCaptcha
  Enterprise). Provision a separate university-owned production project before
  enabling the manual production deploy job.
- [ ] Configure the `staging` and `production` GitHub environments with
  `FIREBASE_TOKEN` plus all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` build variables listed in
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- [ ] `.firebaserc` and the staging job target the same explicitly approved
  staging project. Production deploys remain disabled until a separate
  production project replaces the placeholder target behind the protected
  `production` environment. Record actual project IDs only in the private
  university handover record.
- [ ] Verify the `Deploy` workflow promotes main to staging automatically after
  a green `Production verification` run, and that staging smoke checks (rules,
  hosting headers, App Check) pass before any production dispatch.
- [ ] Deploy and monitor the committed `firestore.indexes.json`; retention and
  privacy deletion depend on those indexes.
- [ ] Ensure exactly one healthy worker lease owner processes lifecycle,
  stale-state, and retention jobs. The Firestore lease is safe at any replica
  count, so this is about observing the lease, not limiting replicas.
- [ ] Alert on `/health` readiness, rejected telemetry, credential-cache rate,
  device-to-server/processing/RTDB-write p95/p99, watchdog reset reports and
  worker lease churn. Define targets from a real route load test.

## Identity and device provisioning

- [ ] Maintain approved passenger/admin accounts and immutable role claims;
  immediately revoke departed or reassigned staff. Keep operator assignments as
  admin-managed fleet records rather than a separate web workspace.
- [ ] Create one random device secret per ESP32 and store only its salted
  verifier in Firestore.
- [ ] Bind every device to one approved bus and route; document rotation,
  disablement, lost-device, and reassignment procedures.
- [ ] Restrict the browser Maps key by HTTPS referrer and API; restrict the
  server key by runtime identity/IP and Routes/Places APIs.
- [ ] Complete the witnessed
  [ESP32 fleet security and provisioning](HARDWARE_SECURITY_PROVISIONING.md)
  procedure on spare ECO3-or-newer hardware before fleet rollout. Archive
  first-boot evidence that Secure Boot V2 and release-mode flash encryption are
  active; these eFuse operations are irreversible.
- [ ] Confirm every fleet artifact was built with `esp32dev-secure`; development
  firmware is never installed in a vehicle. Verify the runtime hard gate and
  remote diagnostic both report flash encryption and Secure Boot active.
- [ ] Build each device-specific configuration only in the controlled signing
  environment, protect/delete plaintext `secrets.h` and unencrypted artifacts,
  and demonstrate independent signed-reflash secret rotation, revocation, and
  lost-device disablement.
- [ ] Configure immutable HTTPS signed-firmware hosting and all five backend
  release fields; prove active-ride withholding, wrong-key/digest rejection,
  healthy confirmation and five-minute automatic rollback on spare boards.

## Data protection and safety

- [ ] Obtain privacy/legal approval for location purpose, notice, access,
  retention, deletion, incident response, and completed-trip reporting.
- [ ] Verify Firestore/RTDB rules in emulators and production; `devices`,
  `active_rides`, `_active_bus_locks`, internal worker/privacy collections, and
  telemetry writes must remain server-only.
- [ ] Confirm the strict production build (`npm run build:production`) runs in
  CI with the fail-closed env gate and CSP regeneration (issue #39 D1), and
  that the API fails closed without `CORS_ORIGIN` in production (issue #39 D6).
- [ ] Verify the deployed service worker contains no authenticated/default
  runtime cache and that account switching on a shared device cannot replay
  the prior account's data.
- [ ] Monitor rejected device authentication, rate limits, stale devices,
  worker lease loss, backend errors, Firebase usage, and Maps cost.
- [ ] Use fused automotive power conversion, safe antenna placement, protected
  wiring, and maintenance records for each bus.
- [ ] Prohibit drivers from operating the web app or laptop while the vehicle
  is moving.

## Acceptance test

University acceptance is complete only after an authorized team observes:

- [ ] Successful execution of `npm run verify` to confirm linting, unit tests, and production bundle generation.
- [ ] Correct passenger/admin authorization and admin-managed operator assignment.
- [ ] Fresh GNSS positions appear on all panels at measured acceptable latency.
- [ ] Stop 1 alone activates a pre-armed ride.
- [ ] Stops advance strictly in configured order; downstream visits cannot
  skip an expected stop.
- [ ] Parallel start requests on two routes for one bus produce exactly one
  active session/lock; delayed completion from an old session cannot affect a
  newly armed ride.
- [ ] ESP power loss, network loss, GNSS loss, browser refresh, and backend
  restart preserve the active session and recover its stop index.
- [ ] With browser throttling set to Slow 3G (about 400 ms RTT) and then
  Offline, passenger and admin views show reconnecting status, clear
  stale live positions, and recover after connectivity returns.
- [ ] While a production tab stays open, returning to it triggers a service
  worker update check; an activated update reloads once onto matching assets.
- [ ] Only the final ordered stop completes the ride.
- [ ] Disabled/bad device credentials, malformed/stale payloads, and browser
  write attempts are rejected.
- [ ] Alerts, backups, credential rotation, and rollback are demonstrated.

Record test date, route, firmware version, application commit, participants,
measured latency, failures, evidence links, accepted risks, and signatures.

## Student handover package

- [ ] Source repository and verified commit identifier.
- [ ] Build/test/firmware logs and dependency audit results.
- [ ] Architecture, API, storage, and live-demo documents.
- [ ] Non-secret bus/route/device inventory and wiring diagram.
- [ ] Open-risk list. Never request committed `.env`, service-account JSON,
  signing keys, device secrets, firmware binaries, or App Check debug tokens.
- [ ] HLD, LLD, exhaustive Firebase dictionary, hardware latency analysis,
  API reference and test/failure matrix from the documentation index.
